### About me
From school I knew that I would work in IT, it only remained to decide on the profession. After studying for 3 years at the university in the IT specialty, I learned a lot about different areas of IT (working with databases, backend, frontend, ux design). 
After that, I chose the frontend. For what I like the frontend: it combines the most interesting areas - design and development, exactly for the ability to create beauty (and most importantly quickly, a few lines of code can significantly change the interface). I understood this is what I want to work with. 

### Skills
**Programming languages** (*had to work with(studied)*): C#, C++, Java, Kotlin, Swift, Dart, Html & Css & Js;   
**Methodology** (*know in theory*): Scrum, Kanban, Waterfall;   
**Also** (*basic level*): git , development of interfaces in Figma.

### Code example
```javascript
function getMiddle(s)
{
  let index = Math.floor(s.length/2);
  return s.length % 2 == 0 ? s[index-1] + s[index] : s[index];
}
```
